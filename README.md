## Motivation

Lavander√≠a Cotton needed to update their website to improve their old one. They needed one with better maintainability, so I developed a Gatsby website that reads the data from multiple markdown files.

Below I mention several tools I used to develop this website:

- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - A JavaScript library for building static websites
